ManyHands
=========

Chore management for teams

As of late 2013 ManyHands doesn't exist yet in any substantial sense,
but I'm writing down the idea in hope of getting to work on it some day.

ManyHands will be a simple web app that helps small teams (families,
sports teams, social clubs, bands) managed shared chores.  It's a sort
of shared to-do, reminder kind of thing.

The motivation for the project is that there are lots of mundane tasks
that teams of people have to do, and working out who's going to do what
when is often more stressful and time-consuming than it should be.
Maybe technology can help a little.  The big-picture ideas:

* Fair division of work
* Reminders
* Mild social pressure

## Fair division

Emphatic non-goal: chore-doing enforcement.  We assume that everyone on
the team is 

## Technical Ideas

Here are the ideas we've had for implementing ManyHands so far.

There are two non-trivial technical issues with implementing ManyHands:

* Shared "document" management
* Storage/authentication/etc
