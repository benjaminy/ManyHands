biy. Working on the storage wrappers.
Thinking about best way to pass keys and such up and down.
Decided t0 generalize the "path" to a "file pointer" that includes the path, keys, iv, maybe more?

bwc. Working through the X3DH Key agreement protocol from signal.
Feeling as if I am missing the forest for the trees.
The concept specifically behind the ephemeral keys and the prekeys is particulary elusive to me.
I find these concepts particularly confusing at the point when alice recieves the prekey bundle from bob.
I think it would be useful to look at X3DH from the view of the attacks it tries to prevent, because without that insight, this seems superfulous. 
Feeling like I was lacking the bigger picture, I moved to reading the ferguson crypography engineering book for a better big picture understanding of key agreement.
