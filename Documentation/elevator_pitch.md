In the last few years have there have been major revelations of
governmental and corporate data privacy violations.  Additionally,
cybercriminals continue to make headlines with attacks on big
organizations.  The gold standard for privacy preservation in
communication architectures is so-called end-to-end encryption, where
(in theory at least) the service providers who transmit and store users'
data cannot themselves access it.  In this project we are exploring
end-to-end encryption architectures for maintaining databases shared
among small, loosely affiliated teams.  The demonstration application is
a chore-recording app that families, sports teams, clubs, etc. can use
without fear that an attacker could learn about their intimate daily
routines.
